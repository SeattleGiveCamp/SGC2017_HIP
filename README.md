## Email to Little Green Light on Sept 5
Hi Paul,

Our API doesn't yet support creating the volunteer hours, but perhaps this would be useful?

Use custom integrations to send data via webhooks to LGL. We can also turn on the API for this customer also. Here's the documentation:

Thanks!

I read something online about the beta testing of the LGL API. Is this in production yet?

I ask because we are trying to build a mobile app for an organization that could benefit from the API. We would want to insert records to track volunteer hours into the org's LGI database. Is that possible?
